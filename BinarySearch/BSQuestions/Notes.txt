When to apply Binary Search 

when we give an sorted array try to apply binary Search

Que 1: Sealing to a number
give an array arr = [2,3,5,9,14,16,18] (Sorted Array apply BS)
let target = 14
Celing = smallest element in array greater or = target

if Celing ,(arr,target = 14) = 14
if Celing ,(arr,target = 15) = 16
if Celing ,(arr,target = 4) = 5 target <= arr[i]

find the element in arra which are equal or next greater to the target
